Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal! Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses, while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and COVID-19. Coronaviruses vary significantly in risk factor. Some can kill more than 30% of those infected, such as MERS-CoV, and some are relatively harmless, such as the common cold. Coronaviruses can cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids. Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia and bronchitis either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis.
